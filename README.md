AEQuery
==========

General purpose after effects scripting library.

Requirements
------------

Adobe After Effects
Extenscript Toolkit?

HOWTO (wip)

`sudo npm install -g gulp`  
<clone repo, cd to it>  
`npm install` <- gets deps  
`gulp` builds it to the relevant places in the ScriptUI Folder  
`gulp watch` will monitor it and  rebuild it real quick if anything changes  
 from there it's #include "path/to/aeq.js"  
21:03 <              vaporstack > and now I'm outta my league
